## 🧩 About the Project

This project demonstrates a **multi-platform To-Do app** developed with **.NET MAUI**, Microsoft's framework for building native apps using a single C# codebase.  
It’s designed as a lightweight example of how to use **MVVM patterns** and **platform-specific integrations** in a clean, modular architecture.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project can serve as a **template or learning reference** for developers exploring .NET MAUI fundamentals and MVVM architecture.
